Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

I think it's a really convenient method especially if two files have the same attributes or methods. It helps to reduce repetitive work.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Overall this assignment work out really smoothly for me. The instruction is very clear! I would suggest others read the instruction in its entirety first, understand the structure and hierachy of different files. Then start with one file first, write out all the methods and accessors, google everything that they don't understand,try to solve all the problems in the first file. If the first file is completed, then the other files should be really easy.
